NOTE TO GRADER: My create_table.sql is named as createtable.sql. And just a note about the visual, there is a menu for navigation because of the size of the window. If the window was bigger, the navbar looks like the example demo. All changes after the video's commit were just to fix the structure of the github and readme changes. (Changes done by @ 11:53PM 1/19/2025).
